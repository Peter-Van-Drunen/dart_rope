# dart_rope
An implementation of the [Rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)) data structure in Dart.

This is a project for learning Dart (for fun) and also to learn how to implement a Rope.

Also it so happens that there's no existing implementation of a rope in Dart as far as I can tell, so maybe someone writing a text editor will find this useful (but probably not).

This is a work in progress. The hard parts (concatenation and split) are still unfinished.
